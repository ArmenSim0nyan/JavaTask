Unfortunately I didn't manage to finish Appium task, because I forget a lot of things about mobile automation. I will require a bit more time for finalizing mobile automation, that's why I decided to submit only automation of Web and API.

At first, we require to have installed java and maven in your PC.

For set up run:

``mvn clean install``

``mvn test``

UI tests are under test folder in UI package.  
API test are under test folder in API package.
